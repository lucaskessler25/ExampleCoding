# Introduction
Here attached is some example code that I and two graduate students worked on for a project. In this project, I have done the PHP and most of the Javascript found on the HTML pages. The HTML was generated by a the Netbeans IDE WYSIWYG editor. The server was hosted using XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html , which hosts our database and our frontend.

# Notes
This currently works with Quarterbacks, but not other roles. While making this project we figured we did not need to sink in the manpower and time required to actually do the other roles. All the other roles have the same logic, it is just a matter of us having to sit down and actually work on that. It is something I can work on to add later to make the program fully complete.

Another note to keep in mind is the math we used to generate points for the teams to see which team is very basic, as it wasn't something that was very important to us writing it. To actually make a formula to predict what team would draft a player would take a collective brain power that was far superior to us 3 students writing this. This was more a display of our programming experience and not our mathematic prowess.

All pictures supplied are some example photos from the web application, I have also commented the code that I wrote in the .html files. You will see them commented stating that my code started here, and again that my code ended here. All PHP files were written by me, though all are practically identical.
