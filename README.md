# Introduction
Here attached is some example code that I and two graduate students worked on for a project. In this project, I have done the PHP and most of the Javascript found on the HTML pages. The HTML was generated by a the Netbeans IDE WYSIWYG editor. The server was hosted using XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html , which hosts our database and our frontend.
